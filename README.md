# Thought

## Overview

### Purpose

Thought is an organisation concerned with mental health. The main goal of its website is to provide information on how to maintain good mental health which its users can consume to become informed on the subject.

### Target Audience

Thought’s target audience is those who have an interest in mental health and thus can support many different types of users. The website could be used to support your own mental health, shared with those who are struggling with their mental health or be used to recognise poor mental health in the future.

## User Stories

### Must-Have User Stories

- **User Story 1:** As someone with poor mental health, I don't want to feel more overwhelmed than I already do by accessing the website so that I can ensure that I digest the content fully and use it to immediately calm down.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**

  - Layout that prioritises access to vital information for relaxing.
  - Neutral and calm colours that are sparingly used.
  - Clear sans-serif font face to ensure readability for all users.

- **User Story 2:** As a person who is interested in mental health, I want to read further into how I can optimise my mental health beyond the crisis-oriented content so I can ensure the stability of my mental health in the long term.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**

  - Provide links to long form content for those who wish to educate themselves further.
  - All advice should be referenced.

## Design Decisions

### Wireframes

#### Font

The font I chose was Inter. I decided to use only one font for this project because I felt that I could create enough variations using different sizes and weights to instil a hierarchy. Inter seemed a particularly compelling choice because of its nature as a sans-serif font; I felt this was particularly important because it’s easily legible for those who have vision problems or dyslexia as mental health can affect anyone. I also feel that Inter is a very neutral font and doesn’t have an overbearing personality which makes it very appropriate for this context as the font is solely being used as a vehicle to transfer information and mental health.

#### Colour Scheme

### Accessibility Considerations

To ensure accessibility on the website I used alt text on the images I and aria attributes, I also used colours with an appropriate contrast to retain readability, and my choice of font was also chosen with accessibility in mind.

## AI Tools Usage

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT was used to generate the paragraphs of copy on the website, it was very successful at achieving this after refining the prompt I used to be more specific as initially it was writing copy that was too long and not in a paragraph format.

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Results

Summarize the results of testing across different devices and screen sizes.  
Mention any issues found and how they were resolved.  
**Guidance:** Summarize the results of your testing across various devices using tools like Chrome DevTools, as outlined in Phase 2. Mention any issues found and how they were resolved.

### Validation

Discuss the validation process for HTML and CSS using W3C and Jigsaw validators.  
Include the results of the validation process.  
**Guidance:** Document your use of W3C and Jigsaw validators to ensure your HTML and CSS meet web standards. Include any errors or warnings encountered and how they were resolved.

## Deployment

### Deployment Process

Briefly describe the deployment process to GitHub Pages or another cloud platform.  
Mention any specific challenges encountered during deployment.  
**Guidance:** Describe the steps you took to deploy your website during Phase 4: Final Testing, Debugging & Deployment, including any challenges encountered.

## Reflection on Development Process

### Successes

Effective use of AI tools, including GitHub Copilot and DALL-E, and how they contributed to the development process.

### Challenges

Describe any challenges faced when integrating AI-generated content and how they were addressed.

### Final Thoughts

Provide any additional insights gained during the project and thoughts on the overall process.  
**Guidance:** Begin drafting reflections during Phase 1 and update throughout the project. Finalize this section after Phase 4. Highlight successes and challenges, particularly regarding the use of AI tools, and provide overall insights into the project.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements that could be made to the website include the creation of extra pages that link to the existing links to the website, which could consist of a contact form, a blog and animations to create interest and provide further depth to the website.
